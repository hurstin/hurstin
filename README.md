## 🚀 About Me
I'm a backend developer with a knack for turning complex systems into seamless solutions. From mission-critical infrastructure to lightning-fast APIs, I specialize in building scalable, resilient, and production-ready applications that just work—even at scale.

I thrive on:

* Building clean and testable APIs
* Architecting applications that scale
* Supporting developers and helping teams ship faster
* Making backend code elegant, not just functional

Whether it’s open source or production-grade SaaS, I bring precision, reliability, and that extra fire that makes things click.
